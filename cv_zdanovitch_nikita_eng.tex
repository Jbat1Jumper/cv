\roottitle{Summary}

\vspace{-1.3em}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent

Passionate about my work, I'm a software developer with almost 10 light-years
of mileage. My deepest and most peculiar interests seems to be always
aligned with knowledge representation, learning theory, games or all of
them at the same time.

I am constantly looking for problems to puzzle over, so I can use them as an
excuse to not sleep and learn new things. Aligned with that, I'm always
looking for new technologies to try and explore innovative ways to develop
software.



% A Computer Science student at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of
% the University of Buenos Aires. Nowadays I have 7 years of experience working
% in the area of software development.
% 
% On the one hand, I have special academic interest in the field of artificial
% intelligence, particularly KR and learning theory. On the other hand, I am
% passionate about software architecture and meta programming.
% 
% Much of my spare time goes to chimerical projects which work as fuel for
% learning and one of my goals is to dedicate myself to combine science and
% playful experiences.


%
%
% I'm interested in working professionally in the ambit of R\&D and game design, since nowadays it already is a hobby in my spare time.

                As a research intern at the Parietal team my goal was to develop a domain specific language based on natural English to use as an interface to NeuroLang. Neurolang is an open-source python library that enables the analysis of neuro-imaging data through probabilistic logic programming. It seamlessly allow to combine, images, databases, and ontologies within a single framework.

                During my internship I studied how to translate sentences from a subset of first order logic into datalog and then how to interpret a controlled subset of English grammar into the former subset using discourse representation theory.

                I developed a module in Python for the NeuroLang package consisting of an implementation of a non-deterministic parser and the transformations required for a small subset of the query language. It is sill an ongoing work and part of my computer science thesis at University of Buenos Aires.

                As a software developer at Infobiz (now Interprod) I helped with the development of the Ticket Games system  and some of the games that run on it. Ticket Games is a system similar to a slot machine but with a pre-printed outcome \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20180903134404/http://infobiz.com.ar/english/ticket_games.php}{\ExternalLink}.

                

                Some of my contributions to the project where the following:

                Developed a library to print tickets on proprietary printer hardware and interface with anti-tampering sensors
                Developed a GTK\# application for the management of fonts and images loaded to the printer
                Developed a dashboard with Ember.js for monitoring hardware status and system events in the machines
                Collaborated with the architecture design of the whole system
                Developed and maintained a CI pipeline for various projects

                Apart from the work on Ticket Games, I worked on the migration from VB to VB.NET of an accounting software solution for gas stations.
